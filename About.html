                <p>We met for the first time in the Codefirst: Girls Beginner's Course.
                  Coincidentally, we grew up in 2 different cities but have travelled to each other's city on holidays and loved it!
                  We thought it would be interesting to see each other's perspectives on the same city and so here it is!
                  We hope that you will like our stories!
