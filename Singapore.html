                This was one of my favourite lunches in Singapore.
                I would have it almost every day while I was on my 2-month internship near Harbourfront centre.
                The portions are very generous, the price is super affordable and the braised pork practically melts in your mouth!
                TIP: The queue would always be really long and the food runs out really quickly, so be sure to get there early!

                  <p>
                    This amazing market dating back to the 19th century is for a me a key landmark of singapore.
                    There you have many options but you should try the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Fish Ball Soup and the Wonton Soup but also the Dim Sum and Dumplings.
                    TIP: ask the locals what they recommend always good way to experience Singapore from the inside.

              There are so many beautiful flowers near the area
              and it's always a favourite past time of me and my friends to visit the domes because they're so pretty.

                  It is a beautiful neighbourhood where it feels like time has stopped. It is full of restaurants and little souvenir shops but also medicine shops. I really enjoyed walking around the colourful houses with the nice Chinese lanterns above my head.
                  The temple, in the middle of is a key place of the neighbourhood. Its architecture is very impressive but the place is very peaceful with its very big prayer wheel. And don’t forget the rooftop the view over the neighbourhood is worthy the couple stairs.
