  <h4>Favourite Food</h4>
  <p>This was one of my favourite lunches in Singapore.
    I would have it almost every day while I was on my 2-month internship near Harbourfront centre.
    The portions are very generous,
    the price is super affordable and the braised pork practically melts in your mouth!
TIP: The queue would always be really long and the food runs out really quickly,
so be sure to get there early!</p>
